<strong>GifTastic</strong>

This is an assignment that focuses primarily on APIs and AJAX.
In this assignment, we used GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs on a topic of our choice.

I chose 'Disney' as my topic. The webpage will automatically load a number of already made buttons of different movies and characters from Disney. When a button is clicked, 10 of the most relevant gifs will be displayed below. You can play and pause the gif bby simply clicking on an image.

If you want to display a character or movie from disney of your own choice, you can simply make your own button by inputing the name in the input panel on the right. The button will display within the array of buttons.

<strong>BONUS! Click on 'The Full Experience' to play the theme song while you explore gifs. Enjoy!</strong>
